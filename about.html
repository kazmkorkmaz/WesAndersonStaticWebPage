            Wesley Wales Anderson (born May 1, 1969) is an American filmmaker.
            His films are known for their eccentricity and unique visual and
            narrative styles. Cited by some critics as a modern-day example of
            the work of an auteur, three of Anderson's films – The Royal
            Tenenbaums (2001), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest
            Hotel (2014) – appeared in BBC Culture's 2016 poll of the greatest
            films since 2000. Anderson was nominated for the Academy Award for
            Best Original Screenplay for The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Moonrise
            Kingdom (2012) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), as well as the
            Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for the stop-motion films
            Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and Isle of Dogs (2018). With The Grand
            Budapest Hotel, he received his first Academy Award nominations for
            Best Director and Best Picture, and won the Golden Globe Award for
            Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best
            Original Screenplay. He currently runs the production company
            American Empirical Pictures, which he founded in 1998. He won the
            Silver Bear for Best Director for Isle of Dogs in 2018.

          <h3>Directing techniques</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Anderson's cinematic influences include Pedro Almodóvar, Satyajit
            Ray, Hal Ashby, and Roman Polanski. Anderson has a unique
            directorial style that has led several critics to consider him an
            auteur.Wes Anderson is considered a central figure in the American
            Eccentric Cinema tradition.
          </p>
          <h4>Themes and stories</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Anderson has chosen to direct mostly fast-paced comedies marked by
            more serious or melancholic elements, with themes often centered on
            grief, loss of innocence, dysfunctional families, parental
            abandonment, adultery, sibling rivalry and unlikely friendships. His
            movies have been noted for being unusually character-driven, and by
            turns both derided and praised with terms like "literary geek chic".
            The plots of his movies often feature thefts and unexpected
            disappearances, with a tendency to borrow liberally from the caper
            genre.
          </p>
          <h4>Visual style</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Anderson has been noted for extensive use of flat space camera
            moves, symmetrical compositions, knolling, snap-zooms, slow-motion
            walking shots, a deliberately limited color palette, and hand-made
            art direction often utilizing miniatures. These stylistic choices
            give his movies a highly distinctive quality that has provoked much
            discussion, critical study, supercuts, mash-ups, and even parody.
            Many writers, critics, and even Anderson himself, have commented
            that this gives his movies the feel of being "self-contained
            worlds," or a "scale model household". According to Jesse Fox
            Mayshark, his films have "a baroque pop bent that is not realist,
            surrealist or magic realist," but rather might be described as
            "fabul[ist]". In 2019, the company Murals Wallpaper from the UK
            launched a line of wallpapers inspired by the visual design of
            Anderson's films. From The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou on,
            Anderson has relied more heavily on stop motion animation and
            miniatures, even making entire features with stop motion animation
            with Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle of Dogs.

          <h4>Soundtracks</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Anderson frequently uses pop music from the 1960s and '70s on the
            soundtracks of his films, and one band or musician tends to dominate
            each soundtrack. Rushmore prominently featured Cat Stevens and
            British Invasion groups; The Royal Tenenbaums featured Nico; The
            Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, David Bowie, including both
            originals and covers performed by Seu Jorge; The Darjeeling Limited
            and Rushmore, the Kinks; Fantastic Mr. Fox, the Beach Boys; and
            Moonrise Kingdom, Hank Williams. (Much of Moonrise Kingdom is filled
            with the music of Benjamin Britten, which is tied to a number of
            major plot points for that film.) The Darjeeling Limited also
            borrowed music styles from Satyajit Ray's films. The Grand Budapest
            Hotel, which is mostly set in the 1930s, is notable for being the
            first Anderson film to eschew using any pop music, and instead used
            original music composed by Alexandre Desplat. Its soundtrack won
            Desplat the Academy Award for Best Original Score, the BAFTA Award
            for Best Film Music, and World Soundtrack Award for Best Original
            Score of the Year. The soundtracks for his films have often brought
            renewed attention to the artists featured, most prominently in the
            case of "These Days", which was used in The Royal Tenenbaums.
